    <p>My sweet and loving darling,<br><br>I find myself smiling every time I think of you, which means I'm basically grinning all day long! You make even the greyest days feel bright and warm. Your kindness, your silly jokes, and the way you care about the little things that matter to me - it all means more than I could ever say.<br>Being with you feels like coming home to a warm cup of tea after a long day - completely comfortable and exactly where I'm meant to be. You're my favourite person to share life's adventures with, from our quiet Sunday mornings to our ridiculous attempts at cooking together.<br>Thank you for being you, for choosing me, and for making every day brighter just by being in it. Happy Valentine's Day, love. I love you for all eternity, you are mine forever.<br><br>All my love,<br>Yumi.</p>
